|   | კურსისადმი              | by doing, not just studying. This       |
|   |                         | course emphasizes experiential learning |
|   |                         | where students test ideas with real     |
|   |                         | customers, iterate based on feedback,   |
|   |                         | and develop the resilience required for |
|   |                         | entrepreneurial success. I create a     |
|   |                         | safe environment for intelligent        |

|   |                         | opportunities. My role is to guide      |
|   |                         | discovery, challenge assumptions, and   |
|   |                         | connect theory to practice through      |

| 6 | Study Tips |           | - Start customer interviews early –     |
| . |                         |   scheduling takes time                 |
|   | რჩევები სტუდენტს        | - Keep detailed notes from every        |
|   |                         |   interview; patterns emerge later      |
|   |                         | - Don't fall in love with your first    |
|   |                         |   idea; be ready to pivot               |
|   |                         | - Focus on learning, not looking smart  |
|   |                         | - Use visual thinking (sketches,        |
|   |                         |   canvases) to clarify concepts         |
|   |                         | - Study successful AND failed startups  |

|   |                         |   for simulation project work           |
|   |                         | - Form study groups to practice pitch   |

**ANNEX 3 | დანართი 3**

**Course Specific Additional Components | საგანმანათლებლო კურსის 
დამატებითი კომპონენტები**

**Simulation Project Guidelines**

**Team Formation:**
- Teams of 2-3 students
- Diverse skill sets encouraged (technical, business, design)
- Team contract required (roles, decision rules, meeting schedule)

**Project Phases:**

1. **Hypothesis Development (Session 3):**
   - Identify problem worth solving
   - Define target customer segment
   - Articulate solution hypothesis
   - List riskiest assumptions

2. **Customer Discovery (Sessions 4-6):**
   - Conduct minimum 10 problem interviews
   - Document insights using provided template
   - Identify patterns and synthesize findings
   - Refine or pivot problem/solution

3. **MVP Development (Sessions 7-9):**
   - Design appropriate MVP for hypotheses
   - Build or create high-fidelity prototype
   - Define success metrics
   - Test with minimum 5 potential customers

4. **Pivot Analysis (Sessions 10-12):**
   - Analyze MVP test results
   - Calculate key metrics
   - Make data-driven pivot or persevere decision
   - Document reasoning

5. **Final Presentation (Session 15):**
   - 10-minute pitch covering journey
   - Demonstrate MVP
   - Present metrics and learning
   - Discuss next steps
   - Q&A with instructor and peers

**Deliverables:**
- Hypothesis document
- Interview summary report
- MVP demonstration
- Metrics dashboard
- Pivot analysis memo
- Final presentation deck

**Evaluation Rubrics**

**Customer Discovery Interviews (8 points):**
- Quality of questions (2 pts)
- Depth of insights (3 pts)
- Synthesis and pattern recognition (2 pts)
- Documentation clarity (1 pt)

**MVP Prototype (10 points):**
- Alignment with hypotheses (3 pts)
- User testing rigor (3 pts)
- Quality of execution (2 pts)
- Iteration based on feedback (2 pts)

**Pivot Analysis (7 points):**
- Data-driven reasoning (3 pts)
- Metrics clarity (2 pts)
- Strategic thinking (2 pts)

**Final Presentation (Overall impression within 30 points total):**
- Story and clarity (25%)
- Use of frameworks (25%)
- Evidence and metrics (25%)
- Professional delivery (15%)
- Q&A handling (10%)

**Guest Speaker Criteria**

Potential speakers should have:
- Founded or led an early-stage venture
- Applied lean methodology in practice
- Experienced pivot or significant course correction
- Availability for Q&A and informal mentoring

**Technical Requirements**

- Strategyzer account (free tier sufficient)
- Presentation software (PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides)
- Video recording capability for MVP demos
- Survey tools (Google Forms, Typeform) for testing
- Collaboration tools (Miro, Figma for prototyping)

**IP Considerations in Projects**

Students must:
- Disclose if working on existing business idea with IP implications
- Understand that class projects are educational; commercialization 
  requires separate IP planning
- Respect confidentiality of interview subjects
- Not share proprietary information from current employers without 
  permission

**Connection to Program Objectives**

This course directly supports:
- **G1**: Practical innovation competencies through hands-on startup 
  simulation
- **G2**: Understanding how IP mechanisms (patents, trademarks) 
  integrate with lean methodology
- **G3**: Interdisciplinary learning through customer development, 
  product design, and business strategy
